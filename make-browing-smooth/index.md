# Make Your Internet Browsing Experience Faster and Safer


The internet has become a part of our existence now. The fact that you are reading this article is also because of the internet. An internet connection and a browser are necessary to browse the internet. Today I'll talk about these browsers and show how you can use the internet more quickly and safely.

## Selecting a Browser

The first step is to select a browser. Yes, I know you are already using a browser, be it Google Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox, or any other browser. But I would suggest you use the Brave Browser. I myself have been using Brave for the past three years and am quite satisfied with it. I might sound a little biased here, but I think Brave Browser is the best for the following reasons:

<br>

- Brave is a chromium-based browser, you can do almost everything in Brave that you could do in Chrome.

- Within minutes of installing Brave, you can import all your bookmarks, extensions, and settings from Chrome to Brave.

- Brave loads pages 3 times faster than Chrome.

- Brave consumes 33-66% less RAM than Chrome.

- Brave Browser has a built-in ad-blocker and shield that blocks all types of ads and trackers and makes the browser more secure.

- Brave Browser consumes 35% less battery than other browsers.

It is clear that Brave is designed for performance and security. But if you want to use another chromium-based browser instead of Brave, you can still follow the tips below.

## Changing the DNS Server

A DNS server is like a phone book, the browser knows the IP address of a domain by checking the DNS server. But the default DNS server that browsers use is much slower and less secure. So we will use a custom DNS server instead of this default server. Among the different DNS servers, I would recommend Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) because it is the fastest.

> To change Brave DNS server load `brave://settings/security` in the address bar or go to Menu > Settings > Privacy and security > Security. Then turn on the "Use secure DNS" option and select the Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) DNS server.

## Changing Privacy Settings

Every browser has some privacy settings that you should change for your own security. In the case of Brave,

- Set the "Trackers & ads blocking" option to Aggressive mode.
- Turn on the "Send a "Do Not Track" request with your browsing traffic" option.
- Keep “Standard protection” in the “Safe Browsing” options.
- Turn on the "Always use secure connections".

## Flags

Flags are experimental features of Chromium. There is nothing to be afraid of hearing the word experimental. I use flags myself and haven't encountered any problems so far. But it is better not to use any flags without proper understanding. Load `chrome://flags` in the address bar to enable flags.

I always recommend these two flags to everyone-

#### 1. Parallel Downloading

Those who use download managers know that browser download speeds are much slower than the managers. By turning on Parallel Downloading, you'll get download manager-like speed in your browser as well. Simply, turn on this flag to increase the download speed of the browser.

#### 2. Experimental QUIC protocol

QUIC is Google's new transfer protocol. This protocol is designed to make the web faster and more efficient. QUIC Protocol works very well even on low internet speed, so turn on these flags to increase your overall internet speed.
