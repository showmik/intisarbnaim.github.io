I’m not sure about other topics, but I can’t blame them for having this type of mindset when it comes to programming. You really don’t need to know much about programming to get started, at least not at the beginning. Consider my personal experience: I did not learn programming solely for the purpose of learning programming. I just wanted to make a game, and I learned to program since it was needed. I only learned what was absolutely necessary. Later, after gaining some experience, the advanced stuffs were gradually mastered. From this realization, I promised that brother of mine, I will start writing Bangla content on C# myself. The content will be short and to the point that anyone can easily follow it. I was not able to start writing due to a lack of time and opportunity, but now the time has come. And it’s not simply because of the promise; there’s another reason I’d like to start writing about C#. I believe that teaching others is one of the best methods to learn something. If you can’t teach others what you know, you know you’re lacking in it. I want to overcome my lacking and learn more about C#. This is the goal of my writing adventure.

Selecting a Browser The first step is to select a browser. Yes, I know you are already using a one, be it Google Chrome, Mozilla’s Firefox, or any other browser. But I would suggest you use the Brave Browser. I have been using Brave for the past three years and I am quite satisfied with it. I might sound a little biased here, but I think the Brave browser is the best for the following reasons: Brave is a chromium-based browser, you can do almost everything in Brave that you could do in Chrome. Within minutes of installing Brave, you can import all your bookmarks, extensions, and settings from Chrome to Brave. Brave loads pages 3 times faster than Chrome. Brave consumes 33-66% less RAM than Chrome. Brave Browser has a built-in ad-blocker and shield that blocks all types of ads and trackers and makes the browser more secure. Brave Browser consumes 35% less battery than other browsers. It is clear that Brave is designed for performance and security1.

Parallel Downloading Those who use download managers know that browser download speeds are much slower than the managers. By turning on Parallel Downloading, you’ll get download manager-like speed in your browser as well. Simply, turn on this flag to increase the download speed of the browser. 2.
