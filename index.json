He was interested in game development with Unity, and I am also comfortable with C#, so I started with this language. While teaching, I noticed he wanted all the resources to be in Bangla, such as Bangla courses, Bangla books, etc. Not only that, he also wanted everything to be concise. What he wanted to learn should be to the point, nothing extra. But I have a habit of going deep into something when I start to teach it to others. I could tell he didn’t like this bad habit of mine at all.

I’m not sure about other topics, but I can’t blame them for having this type of mindset when it comes to programming. You really don’t need to know much about programming to get started, at least not at the beginning. Consider my personal experience: I did not learn programming solely for the purpose of learning programming. I just wanted to make a game, and I learned to program since it was needed. I only learned what was absolutely necessary. Later, after gaining some experience, the advanced stuffs were gradually mastered. From this realization, I promised that brother of mine, I will start writing Bangla content on C# myself. The content will be short and to the point that anyone can easily follow it. I was not able to start writing due to a lack of time and opportunity, but now the time has come. And it’s not simply because of the promise; there’s another reason I’d like to start writing about C#. I believe that teaching others is one of the best methods to learn something. If you can’t teach others what you know, you know you’re lacking in it. I want to overcome my lacking and learn more about C#. This is the goal of my writing adventure.

The fact that you are reading this article is also because of the internet. An internet connection, as well as a browser, is necessary to browse the internet. Today I’ll talk about these browsers and show how you can use the internet more quickly and safely.

Selecting a Browser The first step is to select a browser. Yes, I know you are already using a browser, be it Google Chrome, Mozilla’s Firefox, or any other browser. But I would suggest you use the Brave Browser. I have been using Brave for the past three years and I am quite satisfied with it. I might sound a little biased here, but I think the Brave browser is the best for the following reasons: Brave is a chromium-based browser, you can do almost everything in Brave that you could do in Chrome. Within minutes of installing Brave, you can import all your bookmarks, extensions, and settings from Chrome to Brave. Brave loads pages 3 times faster than Chrome. Brave consumes 33-66% less RAM than Chrome. Brave Browser has a built-in ad-blocker and shield that blocks all types of ads and trackers and makes the browser more secure. Brave Browser consumes 35% less battery than other browsers. It is clear that Brave is designed for performance and security. But if you want to use another chromium-based browser instead of Brave, you can still follow the tips below.

Changing the DNS Server A DNS server is like a phone book, the browser knows the IP address of a domain by checking the DNS server. But the default DNS server that browsers use is much slower and less secure. So we will use a custom DNS server instead of this default server. Among the different DNS servers, I would recommend Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) because it is the fastest. To change Brave DNS server load brave://settings/security in the address bar or go to Menu \u003e Settings \u003e Privacy and security \u003e Security. Then turn on the “Use secure DNS” option and select the Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) DNS server.

Changing Privacy Settings Every browser has some privacy settings that you should change for your own security. In the case of Brave, Set the “Trackers \u0026 ads blocking” option to Aggressive mode.

Flags Flags are experimental features of Chromium. There is nothing to be afraid of after hearing the word experimental. I use flags myself and haven’t encountered any problems so far. But it is better not to use any flags without proper understanding. Load chrome://flags in the address bar to enable flags. I always recommend these two flags to everyone- 1. Parallel Downloading Those who use download managers know that browser download speeds are much slower than the managers. By turning on Parallel Downloading, you’ll get download manager-like speed in your browser as well. Simply, turn on this flag to increase the download speed of the browser. 2. Experimental QUIC protocol QUIC is Google’s new transfer protocol. This protocol is designed to make the web faster and more efficient. QUIC Protocol works very well even on low internet speed, so turn on these flags to increase your overall internet speed.
