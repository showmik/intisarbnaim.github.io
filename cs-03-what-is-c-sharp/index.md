# Let's Learn C# (03) â€” What is C#?


## What is C#?

> C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, type-safe programming language that runs on the .NET platform.

Although the definition is short, there are several terms that need a little discussion.

### General Purpose Language

Here, the term 'general purpose' refers to the ability to do a wide range of tasks using a single language.  Here's a list of things you can do once you've learned C#:
 
  - **Web Application Development:** Using C#, you can easily create dynamic websites and web apps for the .NET platform or any other open-source software.
 
  - **Desktop Application Development:** You can create desktop apps using C#.
  
  - **Mobile Application Development:** You can create multi-platform mobile applications using C#.
  
  - **Game Development:** After learning C#, you can use the Unity game engine to build all types of games, including desktop, mobile, and AR/VR.
  
  - **Internet of Things (IoT):** You can use C# to create IoT apps that can run on different development boards, including the Raspberry Pi.
  
As a result, it is clear that C# is a general-purpose programming language.

### Multi-paradigm

Simply put, a programming paradigm is a style of programming. A programming language has rules or styles for writing and organizing code. That is what is meant by paradigm here. Although C# is primarily an object oriented language, it supports many other paradigms such as functional, imperative, generic. C# is therefore multi-paradigm.

### Type-safety

C# is a **Strongly Typed Language**. It will become clear once we talk about types. For the time being, keep in mind that everything in C# is an object, and every object has a type. Type safety means that objects of one type cannot be interchanged with objects of another type; be it while writing the code or while running it.

### .NET (Dot Net) Platform

A development platform is a single collection of everything needed to build software or applications. .NET is a development platform. We'll talk about .NET in the next post.
