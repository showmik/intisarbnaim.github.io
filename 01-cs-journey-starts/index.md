# Let’s Learn C# - 01. Journey Starts


## Some Words

Years ago, I tried teaching programming to one of my younger brothers. He was interested in game development with [Unity](https://unity.com/), and I am also comfortable in C#, so I started with C#. While teaching, I noticed he wanted all the resources to be in Bangla, such as Bangla courses, Bangla books, etc. Not only that, he also wanted everything to be concise. What he wanted to learn should be to the point, nothing extra. I have a habit of going deep into something When I start to teach it to others. I could tell he didn't like this bad habit of mine at all.

## Why Writing

I've learned from experience that beginners in any subject dislike excessive talking. I'm not sure about other topics, but I don't blame them for having this type of mindset when it comes to programming. You really don't need to know much about programming to get started, at least not at the beginning.

Consider my personal experience: I did not learn programming solely for the purpose of learning programming. I just wanted to make a game, and I learned to program since it was needed. I only learned what was absolutely necessary. Later, after gaining some experience, the inner things were gradually mastered.

From this realization, I promised to that younger brother of mine, I will start writing Bangla content myself on C#. The content will be short and to the point that anyone can easily follow it. I was unable to begin writing for a long time due to a lack of time and opportunity, but now the time has come.

And this is not just for the promise, there's another reason why I want to start writing about C#. I believe that one of the best ways to learn something is to teach it to others. If you can't teach others what you know, you know you're lacking in it. I want to overcome my lacking and learn more about C#. This is the purpose of my writing journey.

## Conclusion

Needless to say, I'm no C# guru. Every time I want to write, I’ll have to do a lot of research. It is also foolish to assume that the writings will be 100% accurate. Please let me know if you find any mistakes in my writing. You can contact me directly on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/showmik1) or by [email](mailto:intisarbnaim@gmail.com).

I hope this new writing journey of mine will be of some use to you.
