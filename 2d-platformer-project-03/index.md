# 2D Platformer Project (03) - Game Development Is Hard…or Is It?


## Description

"It’s been some time since I uploaded the last devlog. I have been busy with my studies and I didn’t have much time to work on my game. But I was still able to get some work done. In this video, I talked about what I did in the last one month and how overwhelmed I felt at some point."
